**Atom Hastebin**

First of all this package was made for own use.

// but anyone can contact me via Telegram (@thiranger) or e-mail (s02180021@stud.cs.msu.ru)

This package has extremely low functionality, but it is also easy to use. In the process of editing your code, press the *ctrl+alt+s* combination to share it. If nothing happens, the package has done its job (nothing should distract you). The link with your code has already copied to your clipboard. Only in case of failure the package will show an alert with an error message.
